title: "A Collection Of Colors"
---

# Getting started
This is [a collection of colors](https://github.com/thomascamminady/dicopal/tree/main), an homage to the [`dicopal.js`](https://github.com/riatelab/dicopal.js) project. This website allows you to quickly browse a variety of color palettes and just copy their hex codes.

I can think of two ways in which this collection might be helpfuls. A) You want to look for a suitable palette, click on the reference, and use the palette from the original source. B) You are looking for a **discrete** palette (the underlying map can still be continuous) and just need some fixed values that you can hard code in your application.

## `dicopal.js`

[`dicopal.js`](https://github.com/riatelab/dicopal.js) deserves all credit for this work. I have only taken the palettes that they have collected and put them up on this page together with the hex codes. `dicopal.js` is using the Apache-2.0 license.



## Stop talking, I want colors
You'll find all palettes below in order sequential, diverging, qualitative. If you
want to browse by source or type, use the table of contents.

```{python}
from dicopal.create_page import create_page_by_type

path = "dicopal.js/src/palettes_apdocc.json"
create_page_by_type("sequential", path)
create_page_by_type("diverging", path)
create_page_by_type("qualitative", path)

```


## How to use?

Either go to [`dicopal.js`](https://github.com/riatelab/dicopal.js) to use these palettes or copy the provided hex codes and hard-code them in your application.

I just wanted to have a collection of useful and beautiful colormaps from which I can copy
the corresponding hex values when needed.
