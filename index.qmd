# `dicopal`
This is [`dicopal`](https://github.com/thomascamminady/dicopal/tree/main), an homage to the [`dicopal.js`](https://github.com/riatelab/dicopal.js)  project. This website allows you to quickly browse a variety of color palettes and just copy their hex codes.


## `dicopal.js`

[`dicopal.js`](https://github.com/riatelab/dicopal.js) deserves all credit for this work. I have only taken the palettes that they have collected and put them up on this page together with the hex codes. `dicopal.js` is using the Apache-2.0 license.

In total, `dicopal.js` has compiled color palettes with the following indentifiers:
```python
[
  "cartocolors",
  "cmocean",
  "colorbrewer",
  "lightbartlein",
  "matplotlib",
  "mycarta",
  "scientific",
  "tableau",
  "wesanderson",
  "otakeito",
]

```

## How to use?

Either go to [`dicopal.js`](https://github.com/riatelab/dicopal.js) to use these palettes or copy the provided hex codes and hard-code them in your application.

I just wanted to have a collection of useful and beautiful colormaps from which I can copy
the corresponding hex values when needed.
